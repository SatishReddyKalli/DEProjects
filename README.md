# DEProjects

I am going to add as many data engineering as possible to this repository from different sources that i get from the internet.

Introduction:
This article will illustrate the steps and tools needed for extracting forex data, storing it into a data warehouse, and analyzing it for future decision-making. For this project, I focused only on the EUR/USD currency.

I will note the steps I took to complete this project and walk through them using explanations and examples from the project. The tools I used for this project are Python, MySQL, and Power Bi.
